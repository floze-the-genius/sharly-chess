- Titles are displayed intelligently: both are shown when they matter (e.g. FM and WIM), but the women title is hidden when the open title supersedes it (e.g. GM instead of GM/WGM) (5.0.0)
- When the _FIDE_ database is installed locally, players looked up from it (including via an _FFE_ search) have their women title filled in automatically (5.0.0)
- A player's record now shows their federation identifiers — the _FIDE_ ID, and the _FFE_ licence number for French events — each linking to the corresponding federation profile page (5.0.0)
- Omit empty lines when importing players (5.0.0)

## Teams

## Fixed tables

The handling of fixed tables has been improved in several ways:

- The tables that the players would have been assigned to are no longer left empty (5.0.0)
- You can now assign any table number as a fixed table without having a duplicate table appearing (5.0.0)
- Changing fixed table assignment mid-tournament is now correctly handled (previous round table assignments are kept) (5.0.0)
- In the admin pairings view you can choose to sort by pairing order or board number (5.0.0)
- In the associated document view you can choose if fixed tables are ordered by pairing order or board number (5.0.0)
- Pairing screens now have option to order by pairing order or board number (5.0.0)

### Special considerations when using the _FFE_ (French federation) plugin

In order to maintain compatibility with the display of table numbers on the _FFE_ website:
- By default, we still leave the orignal table empty when the players are moved to a fixed table number (5.0.0)
- In this compatibility mode, duplicate tables still occur when fixed table numbers are inside the normal table range (5.0.0)
- This behavior can be changed in the _FFE_ plugin section of event's configuration (5.0.0)

## Screens

- Menu support has been completely redesigned for a better experience (5.0.0)
- Screen families have been renamed **Multi-Screens** (5.0.0)

- Vertical lines are now displayed between columns (5.0.0)
- A new **Chess 960** plugin allows you to display start positions for each round (5.0.0)

## Documents

- Norm reports generated before the end of the tournament now assume that players will play the remaining rounds for the purposes of displaying 1.5.6a and 1.4.3d (5.0.0)
- Title norm calculations now take women titles into account: opponents holding a WGM or WIM title are correctly counted towards the 1.4.5 and 1.4.3d requirements, even when they also hold an open title (5.0.0)
- The pairings document now has an option to include a federation column (5.0.0)
- Upload documents to a custom location thanks to new plugin **Custom upload** (5.0.0)
